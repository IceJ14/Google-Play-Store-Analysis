# Google-Play-Store-Analysis
Using a data set sourced from Kaggle.com, we asked if we could model the set of Google Play app installation behavior to analyze what combination of features makes a user more likely to install an app.

## Project description

Thousands of new apps are released onto the Google Play Store every week. An app developer approaches us with plans of developing a new app and releasing it onto the Google Play Store. The developer does not know exactly what the app will look like in terms of size, functionality, category, etc. 


### Goal
The developer does have a goal: to have the app installed on as many devices as possible. 
1. Create a dependent variable which best describes an app’s success.
1. Model previous 2020 Google Play app installation behavior to analyze what combination of parameters makes a user more likely to install an app.
1. Narrow down the data set to an accurate representation of the 2020 Google Play Store. 

### Analytics Objectives / Questions
1. Can we model the previous Google Play app installation behavior to analyze what combination of parameters makes a user more likely to install an app?
1. Is there a correlation between the App’s rating and the number of installs?
1. Does an app with a higher rating tend to have more installs? Are there outliers?
1. Do free apps tend to be downloaded more than non-free apps?
1. What is the correlation between app price and the number of installs?
1. Is there a correlation between app category and the number of installs?
1. Does the app size have an effect on the number of downloads?
1. Are apps released earlier in 2020 installed more on average than later releases?
1. Is there app seasonality?
1. Is there a correlation between the content rating and the average number of downloads?
1. Do apps that receive an ‘Editors Choice’ rating get more installs?
1. Do ad support apps fare better than non-ad support apps?
1. Are apps with in-app purchases more download than apps without in-app purchases?
